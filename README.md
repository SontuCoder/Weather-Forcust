The three main stages of the SHWAS project, are:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This initial stage involves understanding the data that has been collected. The goal is to analyze the dataset to identify patterns, anomalies, and insights that could inform further analysis or model development. EDA is a crucial step for preprocessing data and making it ready for machine learning or statistical modeling.
Feature Engineering:

Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from the existing data that can improve the performance of machine learning models. This stage includes selecting relevant variables, transforming them as needed, and ensuring that the features are ready for input into the model.
Model Building:

In this final stage, various machine learning models are developed and trained using the processed data. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict or classify outcomes based on the input features. This stage often involves testing multiple models, tuning their parameters, and selecting the best-performing model for deployment.
